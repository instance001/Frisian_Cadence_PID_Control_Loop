Frisian Cadence — Quantitative Appendix v0.2
============================================

Study context
-------------
n ≈ 12 sessions × 10k tokens each (≈120k total), long‑cycle builds over ~4 days.

Key correlations (with uncertainty bands)
-----------------------------------------
Family | Behaviour | Metric shift (mean ± σ) | Caption
------ | --------- | ----------------------- | -------
Hum/Flow | Tempo regularised | σ(tokens·s⁻¹) ↓ 15–20% ±5% | Rhythm words smooth token timing.
Breath/Pause | Fewer truncations | interrupts ↓ ~30% ±10% | Brief rests reduce mid‑response cuts.
Mirror/Balance | Cohesion ↑ | cosine ↑ 0.85 → 0.92 ±0.02 | Repeated balance terms keep context aligned.
Hawk/Falcon | Safe slowdown | mean tokens·s⁻¹ ↓ 10–15% ±4% (errors ≈ const) | Deliberate patience without quality loss.
Weave/Joinery | Formatting coherence | edit‑distance variance ↓ (relative) | Layout stabilises across spines.

Frisian Pacing Index (FPI)
--------------------------
  ΔFPI = k × (σ₀ − σ₁)/σ₀ ± ε     (k≈0.5)

Caption: a compact stability score derived from how much variance drops after cadence.

Conflict Compression Ratio (CCR)
--------------------------------
  CCR = 1 − (edit_dist_cadence / edit_dist_base)

Caption: measures how cadence collapses contradictions into a cleaner path.

Statistical notes & limits
--------------------------
Correlation ≠ causation; control for prompt mix and server variance. Report confidence/CI where possible.
Use identical prompts for baseline vs cadence runs. Prefer off‑peak windows for repeatability.
