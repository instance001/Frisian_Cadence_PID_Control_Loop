Frisian Cadence PID Control Loop — Text Edition v0.2
===================================================

Plain summary
-------------
Metaphor families (our “Frisian cadence”) act like a soft PID controller:
- P (Proportional) = metaphor nudges (“steady,” “ease the flow”) → immediate pace tweak
- I (Integral)     = reflective echoes → smooth short‑term spikes
- D (Derivative)   = human patience/pauses → prevent overshoot

What this means in practice: use rhythm words + brief rests to keep long builds stable and readable.

FPI (Frisian Pacing Index)
--------------------------
Let σ be token‑rate variance before (σ₀) and after cadence (σ₁). A simple mapping is:

  ΔFPI = k × (σ₀ − σ₁)/σ₀ ± ε     (k≈0.5 for 0–1 scale; ε = measurement error)

Plain‑talk: the more variance drops after you add cadence, the more the stability score rises.

Conflict Compression Ratio (CCR)
--------------------------------
CCR quantifies how cadence compresses contradictions into resolvable vectors:

  CCR = 1 − (edit_distance_with_cadence / edit_distance_baseline)

Plain‑talk: higher CCR means fewer “arguing paragraphs” after cadence is applied.

Confounders to watch
--------------------
Prompt complexity, server/region load, and human pacing drift can all affect σ and CCR. Report these with your runs.

Usage recipe (replicable)
-------------------------
1) Seed cadence family (e.g., hum/flow; mirror/balance). 
2) Mirror the model’s echoes occasionally. 
3) Insert short pauses at boundaries. 
4) Log σ (tokens·s⁻¹), cosine similarity, interrupt rate, and errors every 1k tokens or 5 min. 
5) Compute ΔFPI and CCR; compare to baseline.
